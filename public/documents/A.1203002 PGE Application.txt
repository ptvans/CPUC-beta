BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA In the Matter of the Application of Pacific Gas and Electric Company for Adoption of its Customer Data Access Project U 39 E A.12-03-___ CUSTOMER DATA ACCESS APPLICATION OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY (U 39 E) Dated: March 5, 2012 CHRISTOPHER J. WARNER Pacific Gas and Electric Company 77 Beale Street San Francisco, CA 94105 Telephone:(415) 973-6695 Facsimile:(415) 973-0516 E-Mail:CJW5@pge.com Attorneys for PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY A1203002 F I L E D 03-05-12 04:59 PM -1- BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA In the Matter of the Application of Pacific Gas and Electric Company for Adoption of its Customer Data Access Project U 39 E A.12-03-___ CUSTOMER DATA ACCESS APPLICATION OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY (U 39 E) I.INTRODUCTION By this Application and in compliance with Ordering Paragraph 8 of Decision (D.) 11- 07-056, PG&E asks the California Public Utilities Commission (Commission or CPUC) to authorize PG&E to increase electric rates and charges to collect a total of $9 million over 4 years as the reasonable level of revenue requirements necessary to support its Customer Data Access Project as described in this Application and PG&E’s prepared testimony. This level of revenue requirements supports PG&E’s overall request of $19.4 million ($ 8.91 million capital and $10.45 million expense) to fund the Project. II.SUMMARY OF CUSTOMER DATA ACCESS PROJECT PG&E’s Customer Data Access Project will provide third parties with access to a customers’ electricity usage data via PG&E’s backhaul when authorized by the customer, as required by the Commission’s D.11-07-056. The Project will use a common data format to the extent practicable and will be consistent with ongoing national standards for energy data access, including the Open Automated Data Exchange (OpenADE) Energy Service Provider Interface (ESPI) standard. The new data access services provided to customers and third parties under the Project will include strict but streamlined eligibility criteria to ensure that access to customer data is secure and consistent with the policies adopted in D.11-07-056, including the Commission’s Rules Regarding Privacy and Security Protections for Energy Usage Data. -2- The Customer Data Access Project will implement an electronic customer authorization verification process that will provide affirmative confirmation from customers regarding their authorization of third parties to access their electricity usage data, including not only customer consent, but also customer specification of the scope and duration of the third party access, and the customer’s ability to revoke or limit the third party access at any time. This customer authorization will be comparable to the customer consent forms and process that the Commission has required the utilities to implement in hard copy form for over twenty years under the Commission’s prior customer privacy rules. In addition to this electronic customer authorization process, PG&E recommends two other enhancements to the Commission’s privacy protections under the Customer Data Access Project. First, PG&E requests approval to implement a modest customer outreach and education program on an on-going basis to inform customers of how the Customer Data Access Project will work and the importance of the customer being fully aware of their privacy rights and protections before authorizing a third party to access their private electricity consumption data. Second, in response to the Commission’s guidance in D.11-07-056 regarding procedures for ensuring that third parties protect customer data from unauthorized disclosure, PG&E in this Application recommends that the Commission implement a self-certification process for third parties to certify to the Commission that they meet industry-accepted standards for protecting the security of customer information that they seek to access under the Customer Data Access Project. This “customer security self-certification” process would be administered directly by the Commission and would be modeled on similar self-certification filings that the Commission has required in other proceedings, such as the independent verification and registration requirements for direct access providers under Public Utilities Code Sections 366.5 and 394, and the self-certification requirements for compliance by non-utilities with the Commission’s greenhouse gas emissions performance standard under Senate Bill (SB) 1368 and Public Utilities -3- Code Section 8340, et seq. 1/ III.STATEMENT OF RELIEF AND AUTHORITY SOUGHT A.Estimated Revenue Requirements Table 1 sets forth PG&E’s estimated revenue requirements each year associated with this request (in millions of dollars): Table 1 2013201420152016Total Annual Project Cost ($ millions) $898,708 $(1,606,294) $4,128,588 $5,593,181 $9,014,183 B.Cost Recovery Under PG&E’s proposal, PG&E’s will incur an overall project cost of up to a cap of $19.35 million for this Project from 2013 through 2016. PG&E will record the revenue requirement associated with the actual project cost incurred in a proposed new balancing account for rate recovery from all customers through the distribution rate component. The year-end balance of this new proposed balancing account 2/ will be transferred to the Distribution Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (DRAM) annually through the Annual Electric True-Up (AET) filing, or as otherwise ordered by the Commission. Assuming a decision in this proceeding by end of 2012, revenue requirement associated with actual cost incurred will begin to be recorded in 2013 and be recovered in the 2014 AET advice letter. Rates set to recover subsequent years’ revenue requirements will set in the applicable AET advice letters. PG&E is not proposing in this Application that third parties and/or customers using the customer data access services pay “user fees” for the services, comparable to the data access and other administrative fees charged under other programs, such as to Community Choice 1/See Commission D.07-01-039, mimeo, pp. 157- 162; SB 1368 (Stats. 2006, Ch. 598). 2 /Known as the Customer Data Access Balancing Account (CDABA). -4- Aggregators (CCAs) or Direct Access (DA) providers. 3/ However, if the Commission believes that customers not using data access services should not subsidize third parties or customers who do use the services, then PG&E is willing to consider and implement a user fee approach under which third parties and/or customers who use the customer data access services pay user fees to recover all or a portion of the costs of the service. These user fees could be calculated on the basis of both fixed and variable (usage-based operating and maintenance) costs, or only usage- based costs. In either case, the user fees should be simple and understandable enough to avoid complexity or labor intensity in collecting the fees under PG&E’s billing system. IV.SUMMARY OF REASONS FOR PG&E’S REQUEST AND SPECIFIC AREAS OF INCREASE A.Reasons for Requested Relief PG&E has provided detailed support for its request in this Application and the attached prepared testimony. In addition, PG&E’s Application is supported by the facts and policies included in Decision 11-07-056 and Ordering Paragraph 8 thereof, and in the workshops held by the Commission to discuss customer data access issues. The key reasons for the requested increase in revenue requirements are: !To comply with Ordering Paragraph 8 of Decision No. 11-07-056; and !To provide customers and third party energy management and service providers with streamlined, robust access to customer energy data using the utility’s backhaul in order to foster an increased variety of competitively priced and available energy management services in the marketplace. B.Summary Supporting Increase This Application and prepared testimony attached hereto provide a summary of the support for the increase in electric rates requested in this Application. 3/See, e.g.,PG&E Electric Rate Schedules E-CCA, E-CCAINFO, E-ESP, E-EUS, and E-ESPNDSF. -5- V.COST OF CAPITAL/AUTHORIZED RATE OF RETURN The Rate Case Plan requires a utility to “use the most recently authorized rate of return in its calculations” supporting its results of operations presentation. 4/ Accordingly, PG&E has used the authorized cost of capital information set forth in Decisions (D.) 07-12-049 and 08-05-035. VI.REVENUES AT PRESENT RATES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REPORT PG&E’s rates and charges for electric service are set forth in PG&E’s electric tariffs on file with this Commission.
